# Code for Distributed Deep Learning Course
## Distributed Deep Learning with Google Cloud Machine Learning Engine

#### What we will do in this chapter.

- Create a python package/module 
- Use a canned Tensorflow estimator 
- Train our model locally
- Train our model on the cloud (GPUs)
- Export and deploy our model as a prediction server
- Do online and batch prediction
- Improve our model using hyperparameter tuning
- Deploy our new and improved model as a prediction server
- Setup API service for machine learning model
